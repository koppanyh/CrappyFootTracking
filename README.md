# CrappyFootTracking
This is the repo for the Crappy Foot Tracking project to almost bring foot tracking to the masses.


The idea is to have a pressure plate on each foot that registers either a true or a false based on if you're standing on it or not. An Arduino will read this and stream it to a PC over serial.


Then this data is read by the PC, and used to simulate Vive trackers on the feet to just lift your feet up or put them down. There is no side to side tracking or even tracking of how high you lift your feet, but it's better than nothing.


With this kind of technology you can actually simulate a very basic form of VR walking by walking in place and moving as your feet move up and down. Or you can turn that off and just move your feet up and down when dancing.
